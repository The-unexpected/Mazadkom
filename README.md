# Conflict Plan
* What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises?


- We will have a democracy system so we will vote on every solution we provide (Different opinions).
- In case of a dissagrement the leader or anyone can help this person for his issue.


* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

In this case we will all try to motivate him/her and help him/her on this matter.

* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

No we will try to understand why he/she has this conflict and try to solve it and if there is no hope for him/her to contribute, then we will do his/her work with no problems.
